		<h2>A belaying, rapelling and ascending device with an innovative safety feature</h2>
		<br>
		<p>Petra is a belaying and rappelling device, similar to sticht plate (ATC), but with an
		innovative safety feature. In the event of the end of the rope passing through during a controlled descent, 
		Petra will automatically lock on to the end of the rope and arrest a fall. I helped develop Petra as part
		of a team of 22 for the MIT mechanical engineering capstone class 2.009 - The Product Engineering Process,
		and was one of two system integrators responsible for managing the project as well as being a technical 
		lead. </p>
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>Our brief for this project was to come up with an idea for a new product, develop it over a 6 week period,
		before presenting an alpha prototype in a product launch to an audience of 1100, complete with business plan 
		and a live demonstration. 
		</p>
		<p>With that pressure on our shoulders and deadlines looming, we quickly got organised and started brainstorming
		ideas, developing a few promising ones for presentations, before we settled on an auto-arresting climbing 
		device. The pictures below show some of the stages in this process.
		</p>
		<p>With our product now vaguely outlined, we decided to open up the design space again and considered three 
		different concepts. We also set up a subteam to look into different fabrication techniques, tearing down 
		existing products, while another team went out to talk to get some user data from climbers and cavers at a 
		local climbing wall. I was responsible for coordinating these teams: by nominating a ‘team leader’ from each 
		subteam, I could organise small-group meetings and effectively stay abreast of developments.

		<h2>How It Works</h2>
		<br>
		<p>All three concepts work using a similar principle: when the rope passes through both sides of the device,
		it can move freely in both directions; the climber controls the angle that the rope leaves the device to change 
		the friction force on the rope and so can change the speed of descent. However, if the free end of the rope 
		passes through, a cam with a spiral profile moves into the rope and engage it. The spiral profile acts to create 
		a positive feedback loop: the friction between the rope and the cam causes the cam to rotate more, which compresses
		the rope and increases the friction force. 
		</p>
		<p>Once the rope has been caught, the climber is faced with a tricky climb back up the rope to safety. Fortunately,
		Petra doubles as an ascending device: when the rope only passes through one side, the sprung cams will only let 
		the rope pass through one way, just like a normal mechanical ascender.
		</p>
		<h2>Solution</h2>
		<p>Testing showed that the Single Cam design worked best, so this was refined and exhibited at our technical review
		session. The central cam was waterjetted out of 6061 aluminium to create the toothed profile, the rope guides were
		3D printed out of ABS, the backplate was cut from box-section aluminium, and it was all assembled with bolts. This 
		early prototype was capable of catching a 120lb weight dropped by 1 meter.</p>
		<p>We now had 3 weeks to refine the design and prepare for the final presentation. To achieve the goals set out in 
		our original product specification, we had to double the maximum load to 240lb. We did this by identifying some key
		areas for improvement:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Decrease friction at the pivot - achieved by turning the pivot pin to +-0.002” tolerance, and reaming 
			the hole in the cam. Silicon-bronze washers were also used.</li>
			<li>Decrease friction between roller and rope - in order to let the rope travel smoothly when the cam was 
			not engaged, we use an aluminium roller with bronze bushings.</li>
			<li>Reduce wear on the cam - our testing showed that the teeth on the aluminium cam were already dulling 
			from repeated catches. We solved this by jetting the cam out of stainless steel instead.</li>
			<li>Improve useability - after showing the prototype to climbers, there was confusion as to how to load 
			the rope into it correctly. We improved this by anodising the front plate, then laser-etching a graphic 
			onto it to show the correct method. </li>
			<li>Improve ascending feature - by adding a hole to the top of the device, a small rope can be passed 
			through and attached to the climber’s harness. This holds the device steady against their chest.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Presentation</h2>
		<br>
		<p>The final step was to present Petra to a live audience of 1100 people, with 2500 more watching online. I 
		helped field questions on the technical side of things in the Q&A session that followed the main presentation. 
		The whole presentation can be found online, by clicking the button below. The presentation was a success: we demo’d
		Petra live on stage, as two climbers rappelled from the ceiling above 36” crash mats - one using Petra, the other 
		using a traditional ATC device. Fortunately, we ended up only needing one of the crash mats (watch the video to find 
		out which!). You can also find the brochure that accompanied the presentation at the link below.
