		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<br>
		<p>Autonomous vehicles have been around for a long while now, as have the algorithms used to make their controllers. 
		As part of ‘2.017 - Design of Electromechanical Robotic Systems’ we were tasked with making use of random process 
		modelling to inform such a controller in a novel setting.
		</p>
		<p>Waterjet powered craft presented an interesting case. In a team of 5, we set out an objective to use a spectral 
		description of waves to help our controller drive a jet-propelled craft at a constant heading. We identified this 
		as the first step in making a fully autonomous waterjet-propelled craft, with applications for jetskis and in flood 
		disaster relief.
		</p>
		<h2>Solution</h2>
		<br>
		<p>This project was split into hardware and software. <a href="https://lsaintmakesthings.wordpress.com/">Lauren St Hilaire</a>
		and I took on the hardware side, while Ava, Alicia and Lauren F worked on the sensors and controller. Lauren and I conducted a 
		literature review to learn more about the dynamics of waterjets, using SFME calculations to characterise a small, 
		off-the-shelf impeller unit and provide a starting point to spec out the other pieces of hardware - making sure the 
		electric motor had the right kV rating to spin at the required speed, getting a servo that was big enough to turn 
		the nozzle, and getting a shaft coupling that could cope with the high rotation speed. Allowing more time for this 
		design phase of the project avoided unforeseen problems later on, as all the components we bought in worked together 
		first time. We also designed a sheet metal part to mount the motor, impeller, and servomotor, which could then be 
		easily attached to the kayak using two bolts. Our first iteration of the housing was not stiff enough to resists the 
		thrust force from the impeller, but the simple one-piece construction allowed us to update the design quickly.
		</p>
		<p>The controller team used a Nucleo microcontroller to handle the computing, as the regular Arduino had insufficient
		power and too few inputs for our needs. We also got a giant rubber duck to act as our preliminary test platform 
		for the sensors + controller, which doubled as a handy mascot. We chose a 9 DOF IMU as our sole sensor.
		</p>
		<p>The heading was calculated using a Crank-Nicolson algorithm to integrate acceleration data from the IMU, and 
		was then filtered using a Bilinear Transform. Initially, we also used data from the magnetometer to try and correct
		for drift, but dropped it after we were unable to get useful readings. Our controller used spectral data for the 
		waves in the river to inform the controller, in order to balance the tracking of the controller with its ability 
		to reject disturbances.

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<br>
		<p>We were able to run our kayak in a straight line for 15 meters (the length of the dock) in small waves. This 
		validated the first steps of creating a full autonomous controller, and served as a proof-of-concept for an autonomous
		waterjet-propelled vessel. We presented our project at the MIT Mechanical Engineering Department DeFlorez Awards,
		and received an honourable mention for our work.
