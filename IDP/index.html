		<h2>An autonomous line following robot, programmed in C++</h2>
		<br>
		<p>For my second year Integrated Design Project, I worked in a team of 6 to design and build an autonomous line 
		following robot, to take part in a timed challenge.
		</p>
		<p>I worked with a partner on writing the software for our robot in C++. The task for the robot was to collect, 
		identify, and deposit small parcels at different locations based on their colour or weight. Our program had to be 
		robust and reliable, to deal with errors with the sensors and irregularities with the motors. 
		</p>
		<h2>Solution</h2>
		<br>
		<p>The pictures above show how we designed our control scheme, with each colour indicating a different source file. 
		This clear layout of the software structure allowed us to work in parallel on the code, allowing us plenty of time 
		to debug, test, and calibrate our program. 
		</p>
		<p>For the line following, parcel detection, and parcel collection/ delivery, we had a choice of sensors and actuators:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Infrared: good for high-contrast, two-state detection. We used 3 for our line following, giving us 6 
			possible states. A 4th was used to assist with turning corners.</li>
			<li>Strain gauges: Gives analog output, allowing for multiple possible states. We originally used this to 
			identify the parcel by weight, but the frequent need for calibration made them too unreliable.</li>
			<li>Light sensors: Also gives analog output. After the strain gauge proved too inconsistent, our design was 
			modified to use a light sensor instead. </li>
			<li>Microswitches: These provided our main back-up checks: has the robot reached a wall? Has it collected 
			to parcel successfully? We used these to activate ‘recovery’ functions, allowing for uncertainties during 
			the run.</li>
			<li>Pneumatics: We used a two-state pneumatic actuator to handle the parcel drop-off, for its reliable linear 
			motion.</li>
			<li>Servo: A servo motor was used to rotate the collection arm for parcels at 90 degrees.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		We ran intermediate tests on the separate modules in the code to spots bugs early, and regular team meetings meant 
		the electrical, mechanical and software teams could work through problems collaboratively. Our ‘recovery’ functions 
		set us apart from other teams, as we were able to cope with a number of possible circumstances: 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Losing the line completely (a ‘000’ state from the infrared sensors)</li>
			<li>Missing the parcel (microswitch)</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<br>
		<p>The late change from strain gauge to light sensor caused problems in the final competition: the collection arm 
		had been made deliberately thin to give larger strain readings, which made it susceptible to bending. An impact 
		during the competition misaligned the arm, ruining our otherwise perfect run, placing us 3rd out of 12. Testing 
		of the sensors for their reliability before integration would have helped to identify the strain gauge issues earlier.
