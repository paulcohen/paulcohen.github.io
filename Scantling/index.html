			<h2>Keeping track of structural members in a 5,000 ton jack-up barge can be hard work</h2>
			<br>
			<p>Fortunately, a well-designed spreadsheet can make the process a whole lot easier. During my time at Global Maritime, I gave their scantling spreadsheet a reboot. The spreadsheet acts as a library of the different structural members that would be used in one of the ships they were building, to keep track of what is being used.
			</p>
			<p>What's more, when the designer decides to use a certain size of stiffener, I-beam, or column, the spreadsheet can perform automatic checks against rules and regulations set out by the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) and alerts them if their chosen member doesn't pass the test.
			</p>
			<p>I was tasked with double checking these automatic calculations against the specifications, as well as improving the usability of the library. I added a macro-enabled filtering function, allowing the designer to immediately find the structural member that would fit their requirements. 
			</p>
			<p>I also tweaked and tuned the little things: I created columns with intermediate calculations that usually remained hidden, keeping the library streamlined but allowing for easy quality control; I also sketched out a dimension convention for the different member shapes so othat the designer knew exactly what size and stiffness they would be selecting; finally, I chose the colour scheme to intuitively indicate which cells required input, and locked the rest to make sure a stray click would not break anything.
